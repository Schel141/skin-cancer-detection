# Skin Cancer Detection

This is a project that focused on the detection of skin cancer based on dermatoscopic images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We built our own CNN to classify the dermatoscopic images but we also used different pretrained models (e.g. VGG16, ResNet-50, MobileNet V2).

# Data Source

We used the HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions
